# D3-Visualization-in-R-Cheatsheet
The repo maintains the D3 visualization in R cheatsheet for course STAT 5702 at Columbia University.

The main reason of the project is to improve and extend the interactive/dynamic ability. When you want to go further in data visualization, the Javascript library D3 will provide a comprehensive support for R.
